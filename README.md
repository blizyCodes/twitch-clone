# Twitch Clone

This is a web application which was created while exploring NextJS and Supabase while also practicing my Tailwind skills.
There is not a lot of functionality yet as my main goal was to understand NextJS and how Supabase can be integrated as a Backend As a Service tool.
For the real thing please browse [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/).

I do not own any of the media used and they were used for the sole purpose of practicing and learning.

(may be offline at times due to Supabase's free tier limitations and the need to keep refreshing the project)

## Tech Stack

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - ReactJS framework
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - for both API and PostgreSQL Database
